# Wood-Defect-Detection-System
The system implemented with OpenCV and Python, classifies wood into four grades by detecting defects such as undersized pieces, small knots, holes, dead knots, and cracks. The system utilizes a General Digital Image Processing Workflow, encompassing image acquisition, preprocessing, segmentation, representation, and recognition. Tailored image processing methods are employed to efficiently identify and grade different wood defects. 

Run main.py to detect the grade of the woods.
